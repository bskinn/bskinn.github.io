The overall theme of the talk centered on the 'Black Swan' concept of significant events
that are unpredictable in advance but seem obvious in retrospect,
based on the [book of the same title](https://books.google.com/books?id=gWW4SkJjM08C)
by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, as applied to Python.  Russell highlighted four hypothetical
Black Swans, phrased as assumptions that are likely wrong, and perhaps badly so:
&nbsp;
(1) Everyone uses a laptop.
(2) Python can stay on the server.
(3) Installation is a solved problem.
(4) Code distribution doesn't matter.
&nbsp;
He described some of his experiences
in trying to address the above four potential Black Swans
through his work on the BeeWare project.
He specifically made the point, though, that the most important Python Black Swan
over the next decade may well be something that no one has thought of yet.
&nbsp;
As a transition into how Python and the Python community might think about the
process of moving the language into the future, he used some of the history of the
[America's Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Cup) of yacht racing
as an illustrative example. In particular, he described how the
[winged keel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Cup#/media/File:Australia_II_winged_keel.JPG)
of the *Australia&nbsp;II* yacht represents a case study in how new technologies can become
positive Black Swans by triggering re-examination of existing paradigms/assumptions,
and how genuinely fair competition requires more than following the existing rules,
if those rules aren't themselves fair.
His takeaway lessons from the America's cup and the *Australia&nbsp;II*, as potentially relevant to the
future of Python and the Python community, were:
&nbsp;
(1) *(paraphrased)* Don't just follow the rules; work to change the rules if they're unfair.
(2) Watch out for Black Swans (maybe Python on WASM...?).
(3) The team matters (think beyond the developers).
(4) Money makes things happen (open-source is an engineering model, *not* a business model).
&nbsp;
Russell wound down his talk by describing the engineering accomplishments of
[C. Y. O'Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Y._O%27Connor),
as well as the extremely negative public criticism of his character and actions,
and analogized this example to the occasionally-toxic interactions that can occur
within the open-source community. He closed with five calls to action:
&nbsp;
(1) Start thinking about Black Swans.
(2) Improve resourcing of maintenance and R&D efforts.
(3) Value contributors and their contributions.
(4) Get out your wallets.
(5) Contribute.
