I do a lot of writing at work. 

A lot.  Of writing.

Proposals... reports... emails, of course. And, in many cases I'm copying content in from elsewhere, whether it's citations, or quotes from PDF, web, etc. sources, or just moving text from one file to another.  On one hand, it's great that Word goes to such great lengths to try to preserve the formatting of the stuff it's copying in; sometimes that's exactly what you want.

Buuuut, most of the time it's *not* what I want. I just want the text, without the "snappy" font and oh-so-carefully-chosen background shading color. So, I use the `Keep Text Only` paste mode quite a bit, to discard all of the formatting:

{% include img.html path="ksotd/CAS_Space-1.png" width="246px" alt="Screenshot of 'Keep Text Only' context menu" %}
