I put a lot of figures, charts, photos, etc. in the various reports and proposals and whatnot that I write for work. While pagecount often isn't an issue for reports, it usually is pretty tight and *extremely* strict for proposals.  Thus, using floating figures with relatively tight text wrapping is a *must*.
