Two years ago, I was delighted to learn that PyCon was going to be in Cleveland
for both the 2018 and 2019 meetings, putting it only about a 3-hour drive from
my house. I'd been hacking on Python stuff for a few years by that point,
and was excited to have the chance to rub elbows with some of the
people I'd been interacting with online in various ways.  In 2018, I got to
say hello to the big Python podcasters,
Michael Kennedy {% include tw.html user="mkennedy" %},
Brian Okken {% include tw.html user="brianokken" %}, and
Tobias Macey {% include tw.html user="tobiasmacey" %}, as well as
Travis Oliphant {% include tw.html user="teoliphant" %},
Ernest Durbin {% include tw.html user="ewdurbin" %},
Brett Cannon {% include tw.html user="brettsky" %}, and numerous
other well-known figures in the Python universe.  I also had the chance to
eat lunch with Guido {% include tw.html user="gvanrossum" %} and others from
Dropbox, which was quite fun. All in all, it definitely whetted my
appetite to return in 2019.

This year, I was able to attend for all three days of talks, plus part of
the first day of sprints.  This post is an attempt to record everything I can
recall about the experience, though I'm sure I've forgotten a substantial
fraction. Apologies to anyone I've missed, or for any incorrect details!
Lacking any particular organizational plan for this, I'm just tossing
everything into a couple of sets of loosely-related bullets/sections.


**Lightning Talk**

I got to give a lightning talk! I submitted `pent`
{% include gh.html user="bskinn" repo="pent" %},
my early-stage side project for extraction of structured data from free text,
and was slotted into the Saturday PM session.  I thought it went quite well,
especially given that I made a live code demo of it. (Typing accurately through
stage nerves is an ... interesting...  challenge.) The video is
up on YouTube, at ***x:xx***. As I say in the talk, the ***docs*** are still in
progress...they're the next thing on my list after I finish this post.

I need to make particular note here, though: the talk wouldn't have happened
if not for the generosity of Jonas Neubert
{% include tw.html user="jonemo" %}, who loaned me his laptop for a couple
of hours.  Thanks again, and my apologies for leaving your `cmd` windows
set to 28-pt black-on-white!


**Misc Connections/Events**

- The first event I attended Friday morning was the meet-and-greet open
space set up for the PyPA/packaging group.  I met Carol Willing
{% include tw.html user="WillingCarol" %},
Sumana Harihareswara {% include tw.html user="brainwane" %},
and Pradyun Gedam {% include tw.html user="pradyunsg" %} briefly,
as well as at least 3-4 other people whose names I didn't get.
- I ended up spending a fair amount of time at the JetBrains booth on the
trade show floor:
  - I talked to Matt Harrison
{% include tw.html user="__mharrison__" %} about his training services
  - I got some tips about tracking down PyCharm keyboard shortcuts from
Elizaveta Shashkova {% include tw.html user="lisa_shashkova" %}.
  - I also talked a bit with a few other JetBrains employees, as well as with
Michael Kennedy {% include tw.html user="mkennedy" %},
Christopher Burke {% include tw.html user="captainbatman" %}, and
Stephen Schroeder ***CHECK HIS CARD FOR CONTACT INFO***. I 
  - I also got to be there for the live recording of Python Bytes
{% include tw.html user="pythonbytes" %} #xxx ***ADD LINK***, which I
had missed last year.
  - I also caught bits and pieces of some of the various content-creators'
    mini-presentations they'd scheduled
