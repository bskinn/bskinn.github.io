title: 'Keyboard Shortcut of the Day (KSotD): Introduction'
tags: ksotd administrative
---

A significant part of my day-to-day productivity is the heavy use of keyboard shortcuts. Mousing is valuable in a lot of situations, but when selecting/executing a specific command while typing, the time involved in mousing is a major slowdown:

1. Move hand to mouse
2. Navigate mouse through one (or usually more menus)
3. Click to select the desired command
4. Move hand back to keyboard

This is a fairly significant interruption if the command involves just a single click; it's positively glacial if multiple clicks are needed, or especially if multiple hops from keyboard to mouse and back are required.

Thus: *Keyboard shortcuts are **amazing***.

I search out built-in shortcuts for every application I use regularly, mostly on Windows and in Microsoft Office, but not limited to those.  I also make heavy use of Word's ability to assign keystroke combinations both to internal functions and to custom macros.  This "KSotD" feature will recur regularly (though probably not *daily*), and will highlight the shortcuts I use to speed up my workflows. To be clear, some of these shortcuts will involve 'keyboard-modified mouse clicks', breaking the paradigm of the title a bit, but ... whatever.
