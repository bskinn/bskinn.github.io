Being an engineer, I work with equations a lot.  Word's built-in tooling for handling equations has improved dramatically over the last few versions of Office, culminating in the current edition of the Equation Tools:

One of the nicest things about this feature is that they've implemented a subset of LaTeX typesetting commands, albeit in a modified way to make them work more naturally with Word as a WYSIWYG application.  Some examples are shown below--a single arrow indicates progression of typing; a double arrow indicates a space bar press:

In any event, for a long time I was using an old-style key sequence (Word 2003 and earlier, IIRC) to insert one of these Equation objects: <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd>-<kbd>E</kbd>-<kbd>I</kbd> (the hyphens here indicate to press each key sequentially, rather than holding each key until the end of the sequence).  To streamline things, I [defined the custom shortcut]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-06-27-KSotD-Custom-Word-Shortcuts.md %}) <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to provide an alternative, yet-faster way to insert one.
