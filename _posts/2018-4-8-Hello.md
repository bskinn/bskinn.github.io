title: Hello!

This is a blog mainly about Python, though some VBA or quantum chemistry might slip in from time to time.

At this point, most of what I've got in mind to write about deals with the nuts and bolts
of my development process--anticipate a lot of 'My How and Why' posts about tooling and configuration.

I'll also be shamelessly plugging my various projects from time to time. (Because, obviously!)

Enjoy!
