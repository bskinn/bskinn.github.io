title: Hello!

This is a blog nominally aimed at Python, though VBA, quantum chemistry, and
Excel/Word/Outlook/Windows stuff are liable to show up quite a bit.

At this point, most of what I've got in mind to write about in the Python space deals with the nuts and bolts
of my development process--anticipate a lot of 'My How and Why' posts about tooling and configuration.

I'll also be shamelessly plugging my various projects from time to time. (Because, obviously!)

Enjoy!
