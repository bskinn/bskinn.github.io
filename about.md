Hi! I'm Brian.

I'm a Ph.D. chemical engineer, working in electrochemical process R&D (electropolishing,
electroplating, etc.).  I've been programming for over twenty years, first in
TI-BASIC, then in VBA, *then* a bit in Java, and (finally!) for the last few years in Python.

I have a handful of things up on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/bskinn/),
with more Python and VBA projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/bskinn?tab=repositories).

I'm also running [quantum chemical computations](https://orcaforum.cec.mpg.de) for fun in my spare time.
My strongest sub-field is vibrational analysis, learned in the course of starting
work on [`opan`](https://github.com/bskinn/opan) (which is still far from done).
Some sense of my interests in this area can be gained from my
[Chem.SE answers](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bquantum-chemistry%5D+or+%5Bcomputational-chemistry%5D+user%3A11367)
on the topic.
